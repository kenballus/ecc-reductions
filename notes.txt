potential paths:
	improve reduction application order
	look at only "active" portions of the graph for subsequent reductions
	detect reduction candidate areas during application of other reductions
	find link between ecc and vcc
	try to integrate conte and gramm (the issue is that some edges will already be covered)

make a better testing system:
	get the graphs from conte paper to use for testing
	verify results against gramm's code
